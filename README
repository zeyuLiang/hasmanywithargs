= HasManyWithArgs

An association that returns records based on arguments.


Usage:

  class User
    has_many_with_args :messages_from :user,
      :class_name => 'Message',
      :conditions => { :user_id => '#{user.id}' }
  end

Supports association extensions:

  class User
    has_many_with_args :messages_from :user,
      :class_name => 'Message',
      :conditions => { :user_id => '#{user.id}' } do

      def recent(how_many)
        find :all, :order => 'created_at DESC', :limit => how_many
      end
    end
  end

Users can now access their messages_from association with an argument.

  account_owner = User.find(1)
  viewer = User.find(2)

  account_owner.messages_from(viewer)
